Summary
----------

Cancer is a group of complex diseases characterized by excessive cell
proliferation, invasion, and destruction of the surrounding tissue
[@Kumar2017]. Its high division and mutation rates
lead to excessive genetic diversity among tumour cells (intra tumour genetic
heterogeneity). As a consequence, tumours can adapt very efficiently to
environmental pressures, in particular to cancer therapy [@Turajlic2019].
This process is known as somatic evolution of cancer.  

Throughout most of its existence a tumour is inaccessible to direct 
observation and experimental evaluation through genetic sequencing of tumour
samples. Therefore, computational modelling
 can be useful to study many aspects of cancer. Examples where theoretical 
 models can be of great use include (i) early carcinogenesis, as lesions are clinically
observable when they already contain millions of cells, (ii) seeding of metastases, 
and (iii) cancer cell dormancy [@Altrock2015].

### Statement of Need
Advanced cancer simulation software [@waclaw2015] often exhibit a prohibitively steep
learning curve especially for new students in the field of somatic evolution of cancer. A software package that is 
 accessible, simple to use, and yet covers the essential biological processes of cancer growth is needed to provide an entry
  point for students and newcomers to mathematical oncology. 

### Cancer growth model
Here we present `CancerSim`, a software that simulates somatic evolution of
tumours. The software produces virtual spatial tumours with variable extent of
intra tumour genetic heterogeneity and realistic mutational profiles (i.e., the order
of appearance of mutations and their distribution among tumour cells).
Simulated tumours can be virtually sampled at random or in specified positions.
By binning the frequency of mutations in
each sample and convolving the resulting histogram with a beta-binomial
distribution to add realistic sequencing noise [@Williams2016], the simulation produces mutation profiles from different tumour regions. 
This makes the software useful for studying various sampling strategies in clinical cancer
diagnostics such as needle biopsy sampling or liquid biopsy sampling. An early version of this 
cancer evolution model was used to simulate tumours subjected to sampling for 
classification of mutations based on their abundance [@Opasic2019].

Our model is abstract, not specific to any neoplasm type, and does not
consider a variety of biological features commonly found in the neoplasm,
such as blood vessels, immune cells, nutrient availability, and
architecture of the tumour surroundings. It resembles the most
superficially spreading tumours like carcinoma *in-situ*, skin cancers, or
gastric cancers, but it can be used to model any tumour on this abstract
level.

The tumour is simulated using a two-dimensional, on-lattice, agent-based
model. The tumour lattice structure is established by a sparse matrix
whose non-zero elements correspond to the individual cells. Each cell is
surrounded by eight neighbouring cells (Moore neighbourhood). The value
of the matrix element is an index pointing to the last mutation the cell
acquired in the list of mutations which is updated in each simulation
step.

### Simulation parameters
The simulation advances in discrete time-steps. In each simulation step,
every tumour cell on the lattice that has an unoccupied neighbour can
divide with a certain probability (controlled through the parameter `division_probability`). The
daughter cell resulting from a cell division inherits all mutations from
the parent cell and acquires a new mutation with a given probability
(`mutation_probability`). 
A new mutation that changes death and/or birth probabilities can be introduced
into a random cell at a specific time step defined by `adv_mutation_wait_time`.
By changing the fitness parameters of a mutant cell `adv_mutant_division_probability`
and `adv_mutant_death_probability` one can model various evolutionary processes
like emergence of a faster dividing sub-clone or selective effects of drug treatment.

The simulation allows the acquisition of more than one mutational event per cell
(`number_of_mutations_per_division`). In that case, variable amounts of
sequencing noise [@Williams2016] can be added to make
the output data biologically more realistic. The key parameters
`number_of_generations`, 
`division_probability` and `death_probability`
determine the final size of the tumour, while the degree of intra tumour heterogeneity can 
be varied by changing the `mutation_probability` parameter. 
For neutral tumour evolution, parameter `adv_mutant_division_probability`
and `adv_mutant_death_probability` must be the same as `division_probability`
and `death_probability`. 

Throughout the cancer growth phase, `CancerSim` stores information about
the parent cell and a designation of newly acquired mutations for every
cell. Complete mutational profiles of cells are reconstructed a
posteriori based on the stored lineage information.

The division rules which allow only cells with empty neighbouring nodes
to divide, cause exclusively peripheral growth and complete absence of
dynamics in the tumour centre. To allow for variable degrees of growth
inside the tumour, we introduced a death process. At every time step,
after all cells attempt their division, a number of random cells die according
to `death_probability` and `adv_mutant_death_probability` and
yield their position to host a new cancer cell in a subsequent time
step.

### Simulation results
After the simulation, the tumour matrix, and the lists of lineages and
frequencies of each mutation in the tumour are exported to files.
Furthermore, the virtual tumour can be sampled and a histogram over the
frequency of mutations will be visualised. Alternatively, a saved tumour
can be loaded from file and then subjected to the sampling process.

### Outlook
Future investigations and expansions of `CancerSim` will focus on  sampling of tumour specimens
in a specific spatial pattern. Additionally, the effects of chemotherapy can be
modelled by the introduction of different modes of cell death. Our model only
considers sequencing noise for mutated cells. Future improvements of our model
will also consider other sources of sequencing noise, e.g., read errors from
non-mutated sites which would lead to false-positive cancer detections.


Download and Installation
-------------------------
`CancerSim` is written in Python (version \>3.5). We recommend to install
it directly from the source code hosted at github <https://github.com/mpievolbio-scicomp/cancer_sim>.

 Detailed instructions including creation of a
`conda` environment are given in the online documentation at
<https://cancer-sim.readthedocs.io/en/master/include/README.html#installation>.
After installation, the software is available as a python module `casim`.

High-level functionality
-------------------------
### Setting up the cancer simulation parameters
The parameters of the cancer simulation are specified in a python module or
programmatically via the `CancerSimulationParameters` class. 
The table below lists all parameters, their function and acceptable values.
[.,.] denotes a range of permissive parameter values.

`export_tumour` | Export the tumour growth data to file  | True, False


The file [`params.py`](https://github.com/mpievolbio-scicomp/cancer_sim/blob/master/params.py) can serve as a 
template to setup a simulation with all above parameters. Users should start with the template
and adjust the parameters as needed for
their application by setting experimentally or theoretically known values or by
calibrating the simulation output against experiments or other models.

### Run the simulation
The simulation is started
either from the command line, through a python script or from within an
interactive python session. The command line interface accepts as arguments a
random seed, a path for the output directory and a log level. More detailed instructions
are given in the [online documentation](https://cancer-sim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/include/README.html#high-level-functionality) and in the [reference manual](https://cancer-sim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/refman.html#casim.casim.CancerSimulator.run).

For the impatient, we also provide a jupyter notebook with a more condensed
version of the above example (grid size 20x20) at
`docs/source/include/notebooks/quickstart_example.ipynb`. An interactive version
can be launched on the [Binder service](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mpievolbio-scicomp/cancer_sim.git/master?filepath=docs%2Fsource%2Finclude%2Fnotebooks%2Fquickstart_example.ipynb).

A further notebook demonstrates the possibility to dump a simulation to disk,
reload it and continue the simulation with optionally changed parameters
(`docs/source/include/notebooks/run_dump_reload_continue.ipynb`). This
feature could be exploited to simulate cancer dormancy with `CancerSim`.

### Output
After the run has finished, all output is found in the specified output
directory.
Simulation output consists of the mutation list and a sample file representing
the sampled portion of the tumour.
Two pdf files are generated showing the mutation histograms of
the whole tumour and the sampled portion, respectively. If requested by the
parameter `plot_tumour_growth`, a third pdf is generated showing the
tumour growth curve (number of tumour cells over time).
Furthermore, the output contains serialized versions ("pickles") of the tumour
geometry as a 2D matrix, the death list, and the
mutation list. Another directory contains all logged information from the run.
The amount of logged information depends on the chosen log level.

As an example and possible starting point for further investigations beyond the
produced plots, the quick start example notebook demonstrates how to load the
tumour matrix into memory and how to visualize the mutational profile as a
heat map as shown in Figure 1.

The figure shows the central part of the tumour matrix that results from the
template parameter file `params.py` on the X-Y grid with
colors indicating the order in which mutations appear. 0 (deep purple) indicates
no mutation in this cell.
