  "description": "Here, we present CancerSim, a software that simulates somatic evolution of tumours. The software produces virtual spatial tumours with variable extent of intratumour genetic heterogeneity and realistic mutational profiles. Simulated tumours can be subjected to multi-region sampling to obtain mutation profiles that are realistic representation of the sequencing data. This makes the software useful for studying various sampling strategies in clinical cancer diagnostics. An early version of this cancer evolution model was used to simulate tumours subjected to sampling for classification of mutations based on their abundance [@Opasic2019]. Target users are scientists working in the field of mathematical oncology and students with interest in studying somatic evolution of cancer.",
